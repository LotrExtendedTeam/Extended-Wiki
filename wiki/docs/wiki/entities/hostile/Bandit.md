# Bandit

Bandits are men who live across Middle Earth, constantly scouting for victims to loot.

## Spawning

Bandits randomly spawn in groups of one to four arround 20 blocks away from a random player. Different biomes have different chances for bandits to spawn, in general; they spawn commonly in the wilds, uncommonly in most settled biomes, rairly in peacefull biomes like the shire, and never in several completely un-inhabited biomes.

## Behaviour

Bandits will run up to the nearest player and take items from their inventory and proceed to run away at a brisk pace. When killed, they will drop any stolen items they are holding.

## Strategy

- Stay vigalent when walking in the wilds
- Hire some units to gaurd you, as hired units attack bandits on sight
- Pillar up to excape when you see several npcs rushing you

## Lore

Bandits are technicaly the hostile faction, but carry dunlanding appearances and names.
