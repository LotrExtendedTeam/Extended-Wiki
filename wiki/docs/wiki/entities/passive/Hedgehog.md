# Hedgehog


**Hedgehogs** are small, passive ambient animals found throughout many regions of Middle-earth. They pose no threat to players and primarily serve as a decorative and atmospheric creature.

## Spawning

Hedgehogs commonly spawn in the following biomes:  
- Anduin Vale  
- Breeland and the Chetwood  
- Eriador and the Eriador Downs  
- Minhiriath  
- Lindon  
- Rivendell and Rivendell Hills  
- Rohan and the Wold  
- The Shire and Shire Woodlands  
- Woodland Realm  

They can also **rarely** spawn in:  
- Fangorn  
- Mirkwood  

## Behavior

Hedgehogs are passive animals and will flee when attacked.

When fleeing, if a nearby hedge-like block is detected (such as leaf blocks or berry hedges), the hedgehog will pathfind toward it and hide inside, teleporting into the block. While hidden, the hedgehog remains inside for a short time until it is no longer frightened, after which it will randomly emerge and resume wandering.

If a baby hedgehog is following its parent and the parent hides, the baby will also seek out a nearby hedge and hide until it feels safe.

Like [Foxes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fox), hedgehogs will seek shelter during thunderstorms, prioritizing covered areas.

## Breeding

Two hedgehogs can be bred using any type of [Berries](/Extended-Wiki/wiki/Berries) or [Beetroot](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Beetroot).

Breeding produces a baby hedgehog, which will follow its parents until it matures.
