# Hedgehog

Hedgehogs are ambient animals that spawn in various biomes across Middle-earth.

## Spawning

Hedgehogs commonly spawn in the following biomes: Anduin Vale, Breeland and the Chetwood, Eriador, Eriador Downs, Minhiriath, Lindon, Rivendell and Rivendell Hills, Rohan, the Wold, the Shire and Shire Woodlands, and the Woodland Realm.

They can also rarely spawn in Fangorn and Mirkwood.

## Behavior

Hedgehogs are passive animals and will flee when attacked. When fleeing, if there is a hedge (such as a leaves block or berry hedge) nearby, they will pathfind to that block and "hide" inside it, teleporting into the block. They remain hidden for a short time until they are no longer scared, after which they will randomly emerge and continue wandering.

If a baby hedgehog is following its parent and the parent hides in a hedge, the baby will also hide in a nearby hedge until it feels safe.

Additionally like [Foxes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fox), hedgehogs will seek shelter when a thunderstorm occurs.

### Breeding

Two hedgehogs can be bred using any type of [Berries](/Extended-Wiki/wiki/Berries) or [Beetroot](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Beetroot), producing a baby hedgehog.
