# Hobbit Farmer

## Behavior

Hobbit Farmers are usually found on the second story of Hobbit Farmhouses. They carry an iron hoe and a silver coin and wear a Leather Hat.

Like other Hobbits they are passive mobs and will not fight the player unless attacked. Similar to other hobbits they will flee from Orcs or when attacked by other mobs. 

## Trading

Players who have neutral or positive alignment with Hobbits can trade with the farmers.

Hobbit farmers sell products from their farms. This includes vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, lettuce and pipe-weed leaves. They also sell a variety of seeds, as well as items from the barn: wool, leads, buckets of milk, etc.

Hobbit farmers will buy items that they need for farming. These include all types of hoes, buckets, and bonemeal.
